On my journey to become a "Computer Scientist,' I have decided to take up Harvards CS50x Computer Science Course. 
so far I have completed Lecture 0 - and this project was the homework assignment. As per the requirements of the assignment - this project contains:
1) At least two sprites
2) At least three scripts
3) At least one conditional, one loop, and one variable
4) At least one custom block
5) More complex than the games demonstrated. 
Feel free to download the sb3 file and try the game out
